        The ICC will discuss the fiasco in Florida in its annual workshop for match officials next month. A 40-minute delay at the start of the India-West Indies T20I in Lauderhill on Sunday, for "technical" reasons, robbed the match of a result with rain arriving two overs into the second innings. Had the match begun on time - conditions at the ground were perfect at the regulation start time - the match would have been past the halfway mark of its second innings. Only five overs in each innings are required to be bowled for a result in T20 matches.

        "At next month's annual workshop, the match officials will be discussing a wide range of topics, including the second T20I in Florida," an ICC spokesperson confirmed to ESPNcricinfo.
